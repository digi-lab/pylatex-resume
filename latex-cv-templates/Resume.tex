\section{Previous Employment}

\vspace{6pt}

\begin{itemize}

\item{\cventry{July 2010--Aug 2011}{Youth Soccer Coach/Assistant}{Lamorinda Soccer Club}{Lafayette}{CA}{\vspace{3pt}I was a coach for my local soccer club during various winter and summer technical skills clinics. I ran various drills for players aged 6-13 in an effort to promote stronger ball skills for the youngest players in a highly competitive club. This early experience taught me patience through the difficulties faced when working with young children. I also learned to display professionalism and hold myself accountable to my responsibilities as a coach due to the intense personality of my boss. }}

\vspace{6pt}

\item{\cventry{Summer 2010 and 2011}{Babysitter}{Babysitting}{San Francisco}{}{\vspace{3pt}I worked as a babysitter for a couple in San Francisco. I took care of a highly energetic 6 year old named Dylan and occasionally some of his friends. The job mostly involved bringing the kids to local parks and playing soccer with them in order to wear them out. I also assumed a traditional babysitter role and was tasked with looking after Dylan while his mothers went out. This job gave me a chance to practice patience in working with a 6 year old as well as responsibility in being entrusted with somebody's child. The most applicable skill I learned from this experience was time management due to the 1 hour commute time that I was forced to account for. }}

\vspace{6pt}

\item{\cventry{August 2014--January 2015}{Dishwasher/Line Cook}{Koerner's Pub}{UBC Campus}{}{\vspace{3pt}I worked as a dishwasher and then was promoted to line cook at a local restaurant/pub. I was responsible for cleaning all the dishes and maintaining a cleanly dishroom and then for preparing food orders and maintaining a cleanly kitchen. This job experience taught me the importance of separating my personal life from my professional duties, due to the nature of my relationship with my supervisor. It also reinforced the values of hard work and time management as I navigated the fine balance of work, play, and studying.}}
