  abstract = {Social engineering is a real threat to industries in this day and
	age even though the severity of it is extremely downplayed. The difficulty
	with social engineering attacks is mostly the ability to identify
	them. Social engineers target call centre employees, as they are
	normally underpaid, under skilled workers whom have limited knowledge
	about the information technology infrastructure. These workers are
	thus easy targets for the social engineer. This paper proposes a
	model which can be used by these workers to detect social engineering
	attacks in a call centre environment. The model is a quick and effective
	way to determine if the requester is trying to manipulate an individual
	into disclosing information to which the requester does not have
	authorization for.},

  abstract = {Social engineering is deeply entrenched in both computer science and
	social psychology. Knowledge on both of these disciplines is required
	to perform social engineering based research. There are several ethical
	concerns and requirements that need to be taken into account whilst
	performing social engineering research on participants to ensure
	that harm does not come to the participants. These requirements are
	not yet formalised and most researchers are unaware of the ethical
	concerns whilst performing social engineering research. This paper
	identifies several ethical concerns regarding social engineering
	in public communication, penetration testing and social engineering
	research. This paper discusses the identified ethical concerns with
	regards to two different normative ethics approaches namely utilitarianism
	and deontology. All of the identified ethical concerns and their
	corresponding ethical perspectives are provided as well as practical
	examples of where these formalised ethical concerns for social engineering
	research can be utilised.},

  abstract = {The field of wireless sensor networking is still a new and upcoming
	one and, unfortunately, still lacking in terms of digital forensics.
	All communications between different nodes (also known as motes)
	are sent out in a broadcast fashion. These broadcasts make it quite
	difficult to capture data packets forensically whilst retaining integrity
	and authenticity of the data packets. This paper examines whether
	and how one can add a digital forensic readiness layer to an existing
	IEEE 802.15.4 wireless sensor network without any modification to
	the existing wireless sensor network. This paper also provides demonstrations
	of a working prototype to show that a digital forensic readiness
	layer can be added to an existing wireless sensor network, if the
	prototype adheres to a list of requirements in order to achieve digital
	forensic readiness in a wireless sensor network environment. This
	is done by performing several demonstrations which resemble real
	world wireless sensor network scenarios in order to show that the
	prototype does indeed add a layer of digital forensic readiness to
	the existing wireless sensor network.},
