People's perception of Banning Spree in India,- We explored the correlations between the various Census data about a particular state and the general ”acceptance” of a particular ban.  - The goal was to see how well does the M.P. and M.L.A represent the sentiments of the states they were elected in.  - The analysis was done using the Twitter API and the Indian Census data of 2011.  - We relied heavily on the Scientific Python stack for Data Analysis and Data Visualization,https://github.com/Linguistics-DTU/DTU_7th_Sem_Project,Aug 2015,Dec 2015
Whole Genome Analysis pipeline for Mycobacterium Tuberculosis,Co-authored the codebase for a genomic analysis pipeline for the thesis   We used Ammonite shell for Scala language to deal with the installation issues on HPC. The issues this solved were - Runtime download of dependencies - No new language / environment installation since Java was already there due to Trimmomatic - Full statically typed scripting solution   We automated the following Manual for the analysis of 72 genomes  https://github.com/BioDragao/tese/blob/master/docs/ITGE2017_Documentation.pdf,https://github.com/BioDragao/tese,Oct 2017,Dec 2018
